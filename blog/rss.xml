            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're committed to building cloud-native, cross-cloud-first applications and services, or you want to support configurable storage backends to meet complex data access needs, or if you're tired of juggling various SDKs and hoping for a unified abstraction and development experience, Apache OpenDAL (Incubating) will be your perfect partner.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="OpenDAL Arch" src="/assets/images/opendal-arch-a614dff17a53ecef1fdbedb43be31c13.png" width="3932" height="2662" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-opendal">What is OpenDAL?<a href="#what-is-opendal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is OpenDAL?" title="Direct link to What is OpenDAL?">​</a></h2><p><strong>OpenDAL</strong> is a data access layer that allows users to easily and efficiently retrieve data from various storage services in a unified way.</p><p><strong>Data Access Layer</strong> means: OpenDAL is in a critical position in the data read-write process. We shield the implementation details of different storage backends and provide a set of unified interface abstractions externally.</p><p>Next, let's try to answer <em>"What OpenDAL is not"</em> and deconstruct OpenDAL from another perspective:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="opendal-is-not-a-proxy-service">Opendal Is Not a Proxy Service<a href="#opendal-is-not-a-proxy-service" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Opendal Is Not a Proxy Service" title="Direct link to Opendal Is Not a Proxy Service">​</a></h3><p>OpenDAL is provided in the form of a library, not as a service or application that proxies various storage backends.</p><p>If you want to integrate OpenDAL into an existing project, you need to call OpenDAL's interface directly through the bindings supported by OpenDAL to access the storage services.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="opendal-is-not-an-sdk-aggregator">Opendal Is Not an SDK Aggregator<a href="#opendal-is-not-an-sdk-aggregator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Opendal Is Not an SDK Aggregator" title="Direct link to Opendal Is Not an SDK Aggregator">​</a></h3><p>Although OpenDAL replaces various SDKs in the application architecture, it is not implemented as an SDK aggregator.</p><p>In other words, OpenDAL does not simply call various storage service SDKs. We have developed our own docking with various storage services based on a unified Rust core to ensure that the differences between services are smoothed out.</p><p>For example, for S3, OpenDAL manually constructs HTTP requests and parses HTTP responses to ensure that all behaviors comply with API specifications and are fully under the control of OpenDAL. Due to OpenDAL's native takeover of the data access process, we can easily implement unified retry and logging mechanisms for various storage backends and ensure behavioral consistency.</p><p>For compatible services with S3, due to the limitations of native storage services and differences in API implementation, compatibility and behavioral details may differ from S3. For example, OSS needs to set an independent header to ensure consistent behavior for <code>Range</code>. In addition to docking with native storage services, OpenDAL will also perform targeted processing for compatible services to ensure users' data access experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advantages-of-opendal">Advantages of OpenDAL<a href="#advantages-of-opendal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advantages of OpenDAL" title="Direct link to Advantages of OpenDAL">​</a></h2><p>OpenDAL is not the only project dedicated to providing data access abstraction, but compared to other similar projects, OpenDAL has the following advantages:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rich-service-support">Rich Service Support<a href="#rich-service-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rich Service Support" title="Direct link to Rich Service Support">​</a></h3><p>OpenDAL supports dozens of storage services, covering a wide range of scenarios and supporting on-demand selection:</p><ul><li>Standard Storage Protocols: FTP, HTTP, SFTP, WebDAV, etc.</li><li>Object Storage Services: azblob, gcs, obs, oss, s3, etc.</li><li>File Storage Services: fs, azdfs, hdfs, webhdfs, ipfs, etc.</li><li>Consumer Cloud Storage Service: Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.</li><li>Key-Value Storage Service: Memory, Redis, Rocksdb, etc.</li><li>Cache Storage Service: Ghac, Memcached, etc.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="complete-cross-language-bindings">Complete Cross-Language Bindings<a href="#complete-cross-language-bindings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Complete Cross-Language Bindings" title="Direct link to Complete Cross-Language Bindings">​</a></h3><p>With Rust as the core, OpenDAL now provides binding support for multiple languages such as Python/Node.js/Java/C and is also actively developing bindings for other languages.</p><p>Cross-language bindings not only provide unified storage access abstractions for other languages but also follow naming conventions and development habits that are common in various languages as much as possible to pave the way for quick use.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="powerful-middleware-support">Powerful Middleware Support<a href="#powerful-middleware-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Powerful Middleware Support" title="Direct link to Powerful Middleware Support">​</a></h3><p>OpenDAL offers native layer support, enabling users to implement middleware or intercept for all operations.</p><ul><li>Error Retry: OpenDAL supports fine-grained error retry capabilities. In addition to common request retries, it supports breakpoint resumable transmission without having to re-read the entire file.</li><li>Observability: OpenDAL implements logging,tracing,and metrics support for all operations. Turning on middleware can directly obtain observability capabilities for storage.</li><li>Concurrency control, flow control, fuzz testing, and more.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="easy-to-use">Easy to Use<a href="#easy-to-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Easy to Use" title="Direct link to Easy to Use">​</a></h3><p>OpenDAL's API has been well designed and polished in actual use.

On March 15th, the OpenDAL project was officially transferred to the Apache Software Foundation.</p><p>This is a significant moment for <a href="https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databend</a>, as it means that OpenDAL's technology and vision have received wider recognition and support from the open source community.</p><blockquote><p>The Apache Incubator was established in October 2002 to provide a path for projects and codebases that aspire to become part of the Apache Software Foundation. Incubating projects need to follow ASF's governance and operational practices, and use ASF's infrastructure and resources. Incubating projects need to go through a series of stages and evaluations before they can graduate to become top-level projects (TLPs) of ASF.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Apache OpenDAL Project Incubation Status - Apache Incubator" src="/assets/images/incubator-project-opendal-095982818f2f177cfd4cd267c8f282c4.png" width="1373" height="1006" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em><a href="https://incubator.apache.org/projects/opendal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://incubator.apache.org/projects/opendal.html</a></em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-opendal">What is OpenDAL?<a href="#what-is-opendal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is OpenDAL?" title="Direct link to What is OpenDAL?">​</a></h2><p>Data is one of the most important assets in the future, and data access is the key for realizing data value.</p><p>There are various kinds of storage services in the market, each with its own unique interfaces and features, which bring a lot of complexity and inconvenience to data access.</p><p>OpenDAL provides a unified, simple, efficient, reliable, and observable data access layer that allows developers to seamlessly use different storage services and enjoy the best user experience.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="M*N to M+N with OpenDAL" src="/assets/images/opendal-power-549a25c15039d5ff165b082cf2fd7476.png" width="5724" height="1518" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>OpenDAL simplifies the process of interfacing different storage services, and provides features such as automatic retry, request optimization, and observability.

It came into being in late 2021, initially as a component of the Databend project.</p><ul><li>On December 21, 2021, <a href="http://github.com/Xuanwo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xuanwo</a> embarked on the design and re-implementation of Databend's storage access layer, <a href="https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/pull/3575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dal2: Add basic operations of <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>stat</code>, <code>delete</code></a>.</li><li>On December 27, 2021, the <a href="https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/discussions/3662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposal: Vision of Databend DAL</a> was put forward and discussed. On December 29th, dal2's implementation was integrated into Databend.</li><li>On February 14th 2022 , dal2 officially separated from Databend's code repository and became a standalone top-level project.

Later, with Xuanwo's efforts, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sccache" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sccache</a> under Mozilla also tried to use OpenDAL to take over the storage layer. In order to provide more comprehensive support, OpenDAL soon added support for GitHub Action Cache.</p><p>Then, <a href="https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RisingWave</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vector</a> were supported as well. The number of OpenDAL users started to grow.
